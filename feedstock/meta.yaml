title: "LCSPP-AVHRR Photosynthesis Proxy"
description: "The Long-term Continuous SIF-informed Photosynthesis Proxy from AVHRR surface reflectance (LCSPP-AVHRR) provides a globally consistent, biweekly dataset of photosynthetic activity spanning 1982 to 2000 at 0.05° spatial resolution. Version 3.2 of the dataset is constructed by calibrating AVHRR surface reflectance bands against MODIS during their overlapping period (2001–2023), followed by training a neural network to emulate satellite-derived SIF from OCO-2. The LCSPP-AVHRR dataset captures vegetation dynamics with higher fidelity than traditional vegetation indices (e.g., NDVI, kNDVI, NIRv) and is suitable for long-term GPP proxy estimation. All data are provided in zarr format in one file to represent biweekly intervals."
